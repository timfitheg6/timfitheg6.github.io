        <p>This is a pong game made by none other than myself. I rather enjoyed programing the pong game. I found myself spending more time on it than I assume I needed to spend. I was fascinated by the many elements that could change to make the game individual, and I can see a much more intensive code could add a great deal more complexity. When programing the pong game, I learned about the literal logic that the computer takes and how improper sequences will be ineffective. I did find it challenging to synchronize all the conditions to each element. For example, the ball touching the bottom of the screen needs to result in a failure condition. This entails the ball stop its motion, the instruments playing the failure song, the extra catcher sprite appearing and displaying game over, and lastly the program shutting down. Many different elements that all need to be executed from one condition confused me for a while but once I got an understanding of how scratch worked It was relatively easy to add sprites, backgrounds, and add and increasing difficulty by hastening the ball speed and randomizing the direction. Overall, this side project has helped my understand coding and video games better
